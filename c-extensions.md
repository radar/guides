This guide explains how to package a C extension as a rubygem.

To get started, we'll add a C method to the `hola` gem from the
[make your own gem](/make-your-own-gem) guide. Then there's some general
[advice](#advice) and some [references](#references) for further reading.

Tutorial: Add a C extension to `hola`
========================================

At the end of the [make your own gem](/make-your-own-gem) guide, `hola` looked
like this:

    % tree
    .
    ├── bin
    │   └── hola
    ├── hola.gemspec
    ├── lib
    │   ├── hola
    │   │   └── translator.rb
    │   └── hola.rb
    ├── Rakefile
    └── test
        └── test_hola.rb

Now we'll add in a simple C extension.

<a id="tutorial-ext"> </a>
Create an `ext` directory
-------------------------

Just as we put the ruby source files in the `lib/hola` directory, we put the C
extension source files in `ext/hola`. This directory contains two files:

    % tree ext
    ext
    └── hola
        ├── extconf.rb
        └── hola.c

Create `extconf.rb`
-------------------
`extconf.rb` tells RubyGems how to build the extension. For `hola`, it reads:

    % cat ext/hola/extconf.rb
    require 'mkmf'

    create_makefile('hola/hola')

`mkmf`, a ruby standard library, automates the process of creating
a [Makefile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makefile) which, in turn, automates
the process of building the extension. When RubyGems installs a gem, it
runs the gem's `extconf.rb` and then runs `make` on the resulting
`Makefile`. The output from make is a [dynamically linked
library](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_object). The naming conventions for these
libraries is platform dependent. You can use this bit of code to find the
filename extension used on your platform for dynamically linked libraries:

    % irb -rrbconfig
    >> RbConfig::CONFIG['DLEXT']
    # extensions are .bundle on my OS
    => bundle

Create the C extension
----------------------
In general, a good convention for the c file name is
`ext/<gem_name>/<gem_name>.c`. While it is somewhat annoying to repeat the gem
name in so many places, it helps to avoid [naming conflicts](#naming), which are
even more annoying.

The C source code for the extension is in `hola.c`, which reads:

    % cat ext/hola/hola.c
    #include <ruby.h>

    /* our new native method; it just returns
     * the string "bonjour!" */
    static VALUE hola_bonjour(VALUE self) {
      return rb_str_new2("bonjour!");
    }

    /* ruby calls this to load the extension */
    void Init_hola(void) {
      /* assume we haven't yet defined Hola */
      VALUE klass = rb_define_class("Hola",
          rb_cObject);

      /* the hola_bonjour function can be called
       * from ruby as "Hola.bonjour" */
      rb_define_singleton_method(klass,
          "bonjour", hola_bonjour, 0);
    }

`ruby.h` provides declarations for ruby's C API, which is where the `rb_...`
methods come from. The `Makefile` generated by `mkmf` ensures that the compiler
knows where this header file is. Some [references](#references) for ruby's C API
are given at the end of this guide.

Again, the name of the file is important, because it matches the second `hola`
in the `hola/hola` that we passed to `create_makefile` in `extconf.rb`.
Similarly, the name of the `Init_hola` function is important, because ruby looks
for a function with this name when it loads `hola/hola.so`. There is a [summary of these
naming rules](#naming) at the end of the guide.

<a id="tutorial-gemspec"> </a>
Modify the `gemspec`
--------------------

For RubyGems to know that a gem contains a C extension, we have to tell it about
`extconf.rb`, and we have to include the C source files in the `files` list. As
you should expect, this happens in the gemspec:

    % cat hola.gemspec
    Gem::Specification.new do |s|
      # ... (other stuff) ...

      s.files = Dir.glob('lib/**/*.rb') +
                Dir.glob('ext/**/*.{c,h,rb}')
      s.extensions = ['ext/hola/extconf.rb']
      s.executables = ['hola']

      # ... (other stuff) ...
    end

This gemspec computes the `files` list dynamically; when you run `gem build`,
RubyGems will include all matching files in the gem. RubyGems automatically
adds the `extensions` and `executables` to the gem, so you don't have to list
them under `files`.

<a id="tutorial-load"> </a>
Load the extension
------------------

The final step is to require the shared object so that ruby will load the
extension with the rest of the gem. To do this, simply require `hola/hola` in
`lib/hola.rb`:

    % cat lib/hola.rb
    require 'hola/hola'

    ... (rest of file unchanged) ...

This works because RubyGems copies the shared object from `ext` to `lib` when
the gem is installed. It seems a bit like magic, but now you can build and
install the gem to see what's going on:

    % gem build hola.gemspec
    Successfully built RubyGem
    Name: hola
    Version: 0.0.1
    File: hola-0.0.1.gem

The `gem build` command creates a `.gem` file from the `.gemspec`. The Gemfile includes
all of the source files, but it doesn't compile the extension; that happens when
the gem is installed:

    % gem install hola-0.0.1.gem
    Building native extensions.  This could take a while...
    Successfully installed hola-0.0.1
    1 gem installed

Where exactly the gem is installed to depends on how ruby is set up. On Linux
with [rvm](http://rvm.io/), the gem is installed into a directory
structure resembling this:

    % tree ~/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.8.7-p352/gems/hola-0.0.1/
    /home/john/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.8.7-p352/gems/hola-0.0.1/
    ├── bin
    │   └── hola
    ├── ext
    │   └── hola
    │       ├── extconf.rb
    │       ├── hola.c
    │       ├── hola.o
    │       ├── hola.so
    │       └── Makefile
    ├── lib
    │   ├── hola
    │   │   ├── hola.so        # <----
    │   │   └── translator.rb
    │   └── hola.rb
    └── test
        └── test_hola.rb

You can see that the `ext/hola` directory contains the `extconf.rb` and `hola.c`
files. You can also see that the install has generated a Makefile, a `hola.o`
object file generated by the compiler, and the finished product, `hola.so`. And
as mentioned before, notice that `hola.so` has been copied to `lib/hola`.

When you require the gem, RubyGems adds `hola`'s `lib` directory to `$LOAD_PATH`,
which is where `require` looks for files:

    % irb -rubygems
    ruby-1.8.7-p352 :001 > require 'hola'
     => true
    ruby-1.8.7-p352 :002 > puts $LOAD_PATH
    /home/john/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.8.7-p352/gems/hola-0.0.1/lib
    ... (lots of standard paths) ...
    .
    => nil

Finally, you can call the C extension's `bonjour` method from ruby code:

    ruby-1.8.7-p352 :003 > Hola.bonjour
    => "bonjour!"

The string `"bonjour!"` came from our C extension. Hooray!

Of course, you should also add a test to the test suite:

    % cat test/test_hola.rb
    require 'test/unit'
    require 'hola'

    class HolaTest < Test::Unit::TestCase

      ... (other tests) ...

      def test_bonjour
        assert_equal "bonjour!", Hola.bonjour
      end
    end

<a id="tutorial-rakefile"> </a>
Add `Rake` tasks
----------------

Building and installing the gem every time you make a change quickly gets
tedious.  To speed things up, it helps to add some extra tasks to your Rakefile
that automate the build process. The following should work on any unix. For
cross-platform `Rake` tasks see
[rake-compiler](https://github.com/luislavena/rake-compiler).

    require 'rake/testtask'
    require 'rake/clean'

    NAME = 'hola'

    # rule to build the extension: this says
    # that the extension should be rebuilt
    # after any change to the files in ext
    file "lib/#{NAME}/#{NAME}.so" =>
        Dir.glob("ext/#{NAME}/*{.rb,.c}") do
      Dir.chdir("ext/#{NAME}") do
        # this does essentially the same thing
        # as what RubyGems does
        ruby "extconf.rb"
        sh "make"
      end
      cp "ext/#{NAME}/#{NAME}.so", "lib/#{NAME}"
    end

    # make the :test task depend on the shared
    # object, so it will be built automatically
    # before running the tests
    task :test => "lib/#{NAME}/#{NAME}.so"

    # use 'rake clean' and 'rake clobber' to
    # easily delete generated files
    CLEAN.include('ext/**/*{.o,.log,.so}')
    CLEAN.include('ext/**/Makefile')
    CLOBBER.include('lib/**/*.so')

    # the same as before
    Rake::TestTask.new do |t|
      t.libs << 'test'
    end

    desc "Run tests"
    task :default => :test

Now typing `rake` will build (or rebuild) the extension before running the tests, as necessary:

    % rake
    (in /home/john/rubygems_hola)
    /home/john/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.8.7-p352/bin/ruby extconf.rb
    creating Makefile
    make
    # gcc output ...
    cp ext/hola/hola.so lib/hola
    Loaded suite /home/john/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.8.7-p352/gems/rake-0.8.7/lib/rake/rake_test_loader
    Started
    ....
    Finished in 0.00182 seconds.

    4 tests, 4 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors

If the C source and `extconf.rb` build script have not changed, then running
`rake` a second time runs only the test suite.

The code for this tutorial is [available on
github](https://github.com/jdleesmiller/hola).

A good alternative to writing your own Rakefile like the one above is to use the
[rake compiler](https://github.com/luislavena/rake-compiler), which does the
same stuff -- and much more -- out of the box. It also lets you more easily
target multiple platforms and interpreters.

Advice
======

<a id="naming"> </a>
Extension Naming
----------------

To avoid unintended interactions between gems, it's a good idea for each gem to
keep all of its files in a single directory. This is the motivation behind the
naming conventions used in the [tutorial](#tutorial). To summarize, the
suggested conventions for a gem with name `$g` are:

1.   `ext/$g` is the directory that contains the source files and `extconf.rb`
1.   `ext/$g/$g.c` is the main source file (there may be others)
1.   `ext/$g/$g.c` contains a function `Init_$g`
1.   `ext/$g/extconf.rb` calls `create_makefile('$g/$g')`
1.   the gemspec sets `extensions = ['ext/$g/extconf.rb']` and sets `files` to
     list any C source or header files in `ext/$g`
1.   the first require in `lib/$g.rb` is `require '$g/$g'`

An alternative is to name the extension like `$g_ext` instead of
`$g/$g`. The result is that the `$g_ext.so` file is
installed into the gem's `lib` directory, and it can be required from
`lib/$g.rb` as `require '$g_ext'`. This also works, though it is
perhaps not as clean as the first convention.

Wrapping Existing Libraries
---------------------------

A common reason for writing a C extension is to wrap an existing C or C++
library. This can be done manually (see this tutorial --
[part
1](http://tenderlovemaking.com/2009/12/18/writing-ruby-c-extensions-part-1.html)
and [part
2](http://tenderlovemaking.com/2010/12/11/writing-ruby-c-extensions-part-2.html)),
but several tools also exist:

*  [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/), the Simplified Wrapper Interface Generator, is
   mature and probably the most popular
*  [rb++](http://rbplusplus.rubyforge.org/) is nicer in several ways but is
   less stable

Multi-Implementation Extensions
-------------------------------

There are several ruby implementations. C extensions that use the ruby C API can
be loaded by the standard ruby interpreter (the MRI -- Matz's Ruby
Interpreter) and other C-based interpreters, but they cannot be loaded into
[JRuby](http://jruby.org/) (ruby on the Java Virtual machine) or
[IronRuby](http://ironruby.net/) (ruby on the Common Language Runtime (.NET)),
for example.

See [ruby-ffi](http://github.com/ffi/ffi) for a way to build extensions that
work with other Ruby implementations.
